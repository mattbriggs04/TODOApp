# TODOAPP
My first ReactJS project. A TODO App with a clean interface while also being easy and practical. 

## Features
* Data is saved on browser local storage
* Add, complete, and delete tasks
* Create categories to divide different tasks
* Assign and change name of TODO list

Can be found and used at https://todokeeper.netlify.app/. 

# Fun Facts
1. Project was originally devloped around Spring 2022. I like to think I've come quite far...
2. I used this app as my planner my senior year in high school. It really does work!
3. This TODO app made most significant progress while sitting in arguably boring classes (easily arguable).
